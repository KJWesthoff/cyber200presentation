							You are free to sail the oceans, but you may ve denied access if you don't comply with the rules, 
							but there is also a "dark web" of shadow ships, going without insurance in international waters that pose a danger to safety and traffics assets around the world (Ghost Ships). 
							
							During conflict civilian shipping are regarded as targets (akin to the dilemmas of Cyber war).

							Standardization is handled at a high level by international treaties by IMO (International
							Maritime Organization) which is an organization under the United Nations
							These rules and regulations are then enabled at a more practical level by entities called
							classification societies, which are often non-profit private organizations who administrate
							detailed technical rules on how to build ships.
							I is highly economics driven, in order to finance the building and operation of ships, they need to be insured, and the insurance requires sound construction

							The ISO and other standards we meet in Cyber security, may seem out of place and old

							Regulation and standards are always evolving usually in hindsight of how things evolve.

							People are often claiming: "They are too fluffy and cover nothing".

						The standards and regulations map in CS is big and diverse,  
						
						We all know the good old ISO 9001 (which is jokingly famous for ensuring that you make the same mistakes consistently) 
						ISO 9001 ensures that quality management systems are implemented (document control, quality measuring, deviation handling etc.. )
						
						It has some of the 'Lean manufacturing fave' with PDCA cycling

						ISO 27001 is similar in that regard, 
						The goal is for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS)

						The standard itself is merely 19 pages long, of which most is an appendix describing a menu of controls which you can choose to implement

					<h2>ISO 27001 vs ...</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Holistic vs Specific</li>
						<li>Flexible vs Prescriptive</li>
						<li>Yearly internal Audits, re-certification every 3 years</li>
						<li>Certification vs Framework/Guideline</li>
					</ul>
					<aside data-markdown="" class="notes">
						<textarea data-template>
						- Scope & Focus
							- ISO 27001 takes a holistic approach, providing a complete Information Security Management System that can be applied to any organization in any industry. Other standards like PCI DSS & HIPAA have a more limited scope, focusing on specific business sectors & compliance objectives.
						
						- Risk Management Orientation
							- ISO 27001 mandates performing in-depth risk assessments & then selecting context-specific controls to mitigate risks to acceptable levels. In contrast, PCI DSS & HIPAA prescribe a common set of controls that all covered entities must implement, regardless of their risk profile.
						
						- Flexibility vs. Prescriptiveness
							- ISO 27001 provides a high-level set of requirements that organizations can implement in a customized way based on their unique circumstances. NIST & COBIT also offer flexible frameworks. PCI DSS & HIPAA take a more prescriptive approach by listing the exact security measures organizations must put in place.
						
						- Internal Audits
							- ISO 27001 requires both internal & external audits of the ISMS to maintain certification. PCI DSS involves annual external assessments but does not require formal internal audits. HIPAA does not mandate any specific audit frequency.
						
						- Certification
							- ISO 27001 certification involves formal audits by accredited third-party certification bodies, resulting in an organization obtaining certified status. There is no formal certification for NIST or COBIT, which offer voluntary guidelines. PCI DSS involves assessments resulting in compliance validation. HIPAA involves occasional audits to validate compliance rather than formal certification.
						
						- Cost Considerations
							- ISO 27001 certification has moderate costs associated with building an ISMS, engaging consultants & conducting certification audits. HIPAA & PCI DSS compliance tend to have lower direct costs, with more reliance on leveraging internal resources. NIST & COBIT provide free guidance with no mandated assessments.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					Standards are critically needed in cybersecurity (as they are in many other applications), it is shocking how much is left unregulated in the
					hands of business
					(with the whole context thereof (short sighted ness)(only answering ot shareholders) etc..)
					With its high level of abstraction, the ISO/IEC 27001 standard provides a methodology covering the cybersecurity scope and ensuring alignment of a business.
					The standard does not address specific subjects, these are to be addressed by domain specific rule works, with which the ISO 27001 works well in parallel.
					Even though the ISO 27001 does not address specific details, having it in place will facilitate achieving compliance with other standards, this makes it well suited for the future.
