					<h1>Standards in context</h1>
					<p>A bit on what standards are and how they do in other industries</p>

					<aside  data-markdown class="notes">
						<textarea data-template >
							Standards have been around forever, initially as measurements in trading.
							Later during the Industrial revolution as a way to create interchangeable parts
							Standardization is a part og maturing processes and Business..

					<h2>Shipping</h2>
					Special case
					(with some odd similarities to the internet):


					<div class="row">
						<div class="column fragment fade-left">
							<h6>Similar</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>Handles goods in transit</li>
								<li>Travels through international waters</li>
								<li>Sometimes, malicious content is transported in packages</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="column fragment fade-right">
							<h6>Different</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>B2B Only</li>
								<li>Large Single, Insured Assets</li>
								<li>Highly Regulated</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<aside data-markdown class="notes">
						<textarea data-template >
							Standardization (classification) in shipping is a prerequisite to getting your ship. 
							financed, insured and to allow it to enter a country/harbor.

							You are free to sail the oceans, but you may ve denied access if you don't comply with the rules, 
							but there is also a "dark web" of shadow ships, that pose a danger to safety and traffics assets around the world (Ghost Ships). 
							
							During conflict civilian shipping are regarded as targets (akin to the dilemmas of Cyber war).
							He who controls the ocean controls world trade.

					<h2>Standards in Shipping</h2>
					IMO -> classification (technical details) -> Asset Insured
					 

					<aside data-markdown="" class="notes">
						<textarea data-template >
							Standardization is handled at a high level by international treaties by IMO (International
							Maritime Organization) which is an organization under the United Nations
							These rules and regulations are then enabled at a more practical level by entities called
							classification societies, which are often non-profit private organizations
							Detailed technical rules on how to build a ship.

					<h1>The Electrical Grid</h1>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="column fragment fade-left">
							<h6>Similar</h6>
							<ul>
								<li>Both Consumer and Business</li>
								<li>Infrastructure that is highly privatized</li>

				<section>Conclusion
					<p>
						Standards often feel wired or not the most rational, as they a often "solidified rather than
						cast in a mold"
						The ISO and other standards we meet in Cyber security, may seem out of place and old fashioned
						in a "move fast and break stuff context"
						People are often claiming: "They are too fluffy and cover nothing", they are

				<p>
					Standards are critically needed in cybersecurity, it is shocking how much is left unregulated in the
