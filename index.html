						<textarea data-template>
							Standards have been around forever, initially as standards for measurements in trading (sizes, weights etc).

							Later during the Industrial revolution as a way to create interchangeable parts
							Standardization is a part of maturing processes for Business..

							Standardization (classification) in shipping is a prerequisite for getting your ship. 
							financed, insured and to allow it to enter the national waters of a country or harbor.
							<br>

							You are free to sail the oceans, but you may be denied access to harbors if you don't comply with the rules.
							<br>

							There is also a "dark web" of "shadow ships", going without insurance in international waters that pose a danger to safety and traffics assets around the world. 
							<br>

							During conflict civilian shipping are regarded as targets (akin to the dilemmas of Cyber war).
							He who controls the ocean controls world trade, just like control of the internet controls the flow of information.

						<textarea data-template>
							Standardization is handled at a high level by international treaties by IMO (International
							Maritime Organization) which is an organization under the United Nations.
							<br>

							These rules and regulations are then enabled at a more practical level by entities called
							classification societies, which are often non-profit private organizations who administrate
							detailed technical rules on how to build ships (and recently also on how to make them pollute less).
							<br>

							It is highly economics driven, assets are expensive and in order to finance the building and operation of ships, they need to be insured, and the insurance requires sound construction
							(There is of course also the human life aspect of it..)

							The ISO and other standards we meet in Cyber security, may seem out of place and old
							fashioned in a "move fast and break stuff, and we do everything perfect context" But it is not different to what happened in other industries before.
							<br>

							Standards are always one step behind, as regulation and standards are always evolving usually in hindsight of how things evolve or when incidents happen.
							<br>

							People are often claiming: "Standards are too fluffy and cover nothing", but in unregulated cases often the obvious basic things are what goes wrong.

						The standards and regulations map in CS is big and diverse,  
						
						We all know the good old ISO 9001 (which is jokingly famous for ensuring that you make the same mistakes consistently) 
						ISO 9001 ensures that quality management systems are implemented (document control, quality measuring, deviation handling etc.. )
						
						It has some of the time typical 'Lean manufacturing faves' with continuous improvement using "PDCA" cycling. 

						ISO 27001 is similar in that regard, 
						The goal is for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS)

						The standard itself is merely 19 pages long, of which most is an appendix (Annex A) describing a menu of \
						controls which you can choose to implement based on the risks and requirements for your specific business .

					<h2>ISO 27001 vs ...</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Holistic vs Specific (Scope and Risk management)</li>
						<li>Flexible vs Prescriptive</li>
						<li>Yearly internal Audits, re-certification every 3 years</li>
						<li>Certification vs Framework/Guideline</li>
					</ul>
					<aside data-markdown="" class="notes">
						<textarea data-template>
						- Scope & Focus
							- ISO 27001 takes a holistic approach, with a
							Information Security Management System (ISMS) that can be applied to any organization in any industry. 
							Other standards have a more limited scope, focusing on specific business sectors and domains fx HIPAA for sensitive health data.
						
						- Risk management
							- ISO 27001 mandates performing in-depth risk assessments & then selecting context-specific controls
							to mitigate risks, other standards such as HIPAA prescribe a common set of controls that all covered entities must implement, 
							regardless of their risk profile.
						
						- Flexibility vs. Prescriptiveness
							- ISO 27001 provides a high-level set of requirements that organizations can implement in a customized way based on their unique circumstances.
							Other Standards/Frameworks like NIST also offer flexible frameworks.
							
						- Audits
							- ISO 27001 requires both internal & external audits of the ISMS to maintain certification.
							Other standards, for example HIPAA does not mandate any specific audit frequency.
						
						- Certification
							- ISO 27001 certification involves formal audits by accredited third-party certification bodies,
							resulting in an organization obtaining certified status. 
							Most other standards and frameworks have no formal certification

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<div style="text-align: left;">
					

					With its high level of abstraction, the ISO/IEC 27001 standard provides a methodology covering the
					cybersecurity scope and ensuring alignment of a business.
					<br>

					The standard does not address specific subjects, these are to be addressed by domain specific rule
					works, in parallel with which the ISO 27001.
					<br>

					Even though the ISO 27001 does not address specific details, having it in place will facilitate
					achieving compliance with other standards, this makes it well suited for the future.
				</div>
				<aside data-markdown="" class="notes">
					<textarea data-template>
						Standards are needed in cybersecurity (as they are in many other applications)
						as it is critical infrastructure, safety and reliability cannot be put ith the hands of purely market driven entities 
						only answering short term to shareholders etc.
