				<h1>ISO 27001</h1>

				<aside data-markdown class="notes">
					<textarea data-template>
					1) Standards in general (context, to other industries (what it does, how it works etc.))
					2) About ISO 27001:
						- Level of abstraction
						- Revision cycling
						- How is it implemented (who/how many are actually using it)
						- Is it good for the future (meta study, contrast and compare)

					3) Interfaces to other standards and regulations
					4) Conclusion, the development of standards in general (Compare to shipping and electrics)

							Standards have been around forever, initially as standards for measurements in trading.
							Later during the Industrial revolution as a way to create interchangeable parts
							Standardization is a part of maturing processes for Business..

							Standardization (classification) in shipping is a prerequisite to getting your ship. 
							financed, insured and to allow it to enter a country/harbor.

							You are free to sail the oceans, but you may ve denied access if you don't comply with the rules, 
							but there is also a "dark web" of shadow ships, going without insurance in international waters that pose a danger to safety and traffics assets around the world (Ghost Ships). 
							
							During conflict civilian shipping are regarded as targets (akin to the dilemmas of Cyber war).
							He who controls the ocean controls world trade.

							Standardization is handled at a high level by international treaties by IMO (International
							Maritime Organization) which is an organization under the United Nations
							These rules and regulations are then enabled at a more practical level by entities called
							classification societies, which are often non-profit private organizations who administrate
							detailed technical rules on how to build ships.
							I is highly economics driven, in order to finance the building and operation of ships, they need to be insured, and the insurance requires sound construction
							(There is of course also the human life aspect of it..)

							Today, the internet is Critical infrastructure, to the same level as the Electrical system
							Electricity flows from supplier (Power plants) to consumer
							It is distributed in closed networks with no international standardization (e.g different voltages and outlet standards)
							However, in the future with more solar power and consumer batteries on the grid it may change, and so will standards and regulations

							The ISO and other standards we meet in Cyber security, may seem out of place and old
							fashioned in a "move fast and break stuff context" But it is not different to what happened in other industries before

							Regulation and standards are always evolving usually in hindsight of how things evolve.

							People are often claiming: "They are too fluffy and cover nothing".

						<li>Intended for many applications, big and small</li>
						<li>Information Security Management System (ISMS)

						The standards and regulations map in CS is big and diverse,  
						
						We all know the good old ISO 9001 (which is jokingly famous for ensuring that you make the same mistakes consistently) 
						ISO 9001 ensures that quality management systems are implemented (document control, quality measuring, deviation handling etc.. )
						
						It has some of the 'Lean manufacturing fave' with PDCA cycling

						ISO 27001 is similar in that regard, 
						The goal is for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS)

						The standard itself is merely 19 pages long, of which most is an appendix describing a menu of controls which you can choose to implement
